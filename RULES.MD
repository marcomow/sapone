By Marko Kolombo  

**_1. Deck Composition_**  
**A total of 100 cards divided into 2 decks.**

**_1.1 Market Deck (60 cards):_**

- **15 Vegetables**, of which:
  - **1 Watermelon**
  - **2 Leeks**
  - **3 Broccolis**
  - **4 Cucumbers**
  - **5 Artichokes**
- **15 Tools**, of which:
  - **1 Broom**

- **20 Single Soaps**
- **10 Double Soaps**
- **4 Four Coins**
- **3 Three Coins**
- **2 Two Coins**
- **1 Diamond**

**_2. Playing_**

**_2.1 Set-up_**
- **Prepare to take notes on the players' scores each round.**
- **Decide together**:
  - **Which direction you will play**, clockwise or counterclockwise.
  - **How many points are required to win.**
  - **How to handle unbreakable ties**: award points to each player, or to none of them.

**_2.2 Game's Aim_**
- **Each player will try during the game to score the maximum amount of points** by collecting the best combinations of cards.
- **Players can collect cards** by picking them from the Market Deck, buying them from the Soap Deck, or exchanging them with other players.
- **The game is played in several rounds**, each comprising several turns; at the end of each round, points are awarded.
- **The winner will be crowned** upon reaching a certain amount of points, usually 20.

**_3. The Round_**

**_3.1 Preparation_**
- **Shuffle each deck separately**, then place the decks in the middle of the players.
- **Distribute two cards from the Market Deck to each player.**
- **Then, split the remaining cards in the Market Deck into two equal-sized chunks**, turn one upside down, and mix them together so that the deck now has some cards facing up and some facing down. **Shuffle the deck once more**, and you're ready to go!
- **Note:** Players should **never reveal their cards until the round is over**! They can, of course, tell (sincerely or bluffing), but never show.

**_3.2 Round's Flow_**
- **Players take turns until the Market Deck has been emptied**; then, they end the current turn as usual, and then they calculate the scores.
- **When the round is over**, each player compares their cards with the others to see who has the best combinations.

**_4. A Turn_**
- **On each turn, each player performs 2 actions in sequence**:
  - **Picks 1 card from the Market Deck.**
  - **Sells or buys 1 card.**
- **Each of these two actions is mandatory.**

**_4.1 Sell_**
- **The player chooses 1 card from their hand and places it face down on the table**, declaring its value. **Bluffing about the card's value is allowed** and can be strategic.
- **The other players will bid one or more cards to buy the card on sale.**
- **FAQ: What if no one wants to bid on a card?** If no bids are made, the card remains with the seller, and their turn ends.
- **Note:** The seller can also explicitly state their desires, e.g., "I want vegetables."

**_4.2 Bidding_**
- **The other players may bid on the card being sold as many of their own cards as they want.**
- **The seller evaluates the offers and will ask for more if they're not satisfied**; if an agreement is reached, the players exchange the cards (the buyer may be entitled to a purchase compensation).
- **Agreement or not, the player's turn is over**, and the next player's turn begins.

**_4.3 Purchase Compensation_**
- **If a player buys a card from a sale, paying with 2 or more cards**, the player is entitled to **1 compensation card** and should draw it from the top of the Market Deck.

**_4.4 Buy_**
- **If not selling, the player can exchange 3 of his cards for 1 from the Soap Deck.**
- the 3 exchanged cards are placed in a discard pile face down, and are out of play for the entire round.
- **Then his turn is over.**

**_4.4.1 Diamond_**

One of the cards that can be drawn from the Soap Deck is the Diamond. 
This card is special as it acts like a Joker. At the end of the round, before calculating the score, the player who has it shall declare which value the diamond will hold, that can be any of the other cards.
> The diamond acts as a duplicate, f.i. the player declares that his diamond acts as a Watermelon (1); in this case it's like there is a second Watermelon card in play.

**_5. Calculating the Score_**
- **As soon as the last card from the Market Deck is drawn**, the last turn begins, and when this turn is over, the round will be over as well.
- **At the end of the round**, the players reveal their cards and compare their combinations.
> as soon as the round has ended, before calculating the score, if any player has the **Diamond** the player should state which value it will hold for the counting of the score (see 4.4.1)

**_6. Combinations and Examples_**

- **_6.1 Most of (Coins, Soap)_**
   - **The aim is to collect more items than any other player.** A card's value is the amount of items on it, written as well as numbers in each corner.
   - **Example:** Alice has a 1 Coin card and a 4 Coins card (total 5 Coins). Bob has a 1 Three Coins card and a 1 Coin card (total 4 Coins). Alice wins for having the most Coins.

- **_6.2 Breaking ties for Most of_**
   - **If players end up with the same total of coins**, they will compare the biggest cards in the set (e.g., who has the most Four Coins, then who has the most Three Coins, etc.).
   - **Example:** Chris and Dana both have 5 Coins. Chris has a 1 Four Coins card and a 1 Coin card. Dana has two 1 Two Coins cards and a 1 Coin card. Chris wins the tie with his 1 Four Coins card.

- **_6.3 Best Collection (Vegetables, Tools)_**
   - **The aim is to get the most diversified collection with the rarest items** of the same seed. 'Diversified' means having different cards of the same seed. E.g., One Broccoli (3) card and one Cucumber (4) is more diversified than having two Leeks (2). 'Rarity', on a scale from 1 (rarest) to 5, is given by the number of a specific card in the deck. E.g., Watermelon (1) is the rarest as there is only one, while Artichokes (5) is the least rare as there are 5.
---

   - **Example:** Evan has a Watermelon (1), a Cucumber (4), and two Artichokes (5). Fiona has a Leek (2), a Broccoli (3), and an Artichoke (5). Evan wins the Best Collection of Vegetables due to having a rarer item (Watermelon) in his equally diverse collection.

- **_6.4 Breaking ties for Best Collection_**
   - **If two players have the same collection**, any additional card of the same seed should be taken into account, following the same principles of diversity and rarity.
   - **Example:** Adrian has 2 Leeks (2), 1 Broccoli (3), 1 Cucumber (4). Brooke has 1 Leek (2), 1 Broccoli (3), 3 Cucumbers (4). Both have equal numbers of different items and the same rarity levels (2, 3, 4). Adrian's extra card is a Leek (2), Brooke's are Cucumbers (4, 4). Adrian wins as the Leek (2) is rarer than the Cucumbers (4).
